# JavaScript
 
The Everything-on-JavaScript repository was created during my journey of learning JavaScript. It combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build foundational knowledge in web development. By exploring these technologies, I gained the skills necessary to dive into more advanced frameworks like React.js. Feel free to explore the code and learn alongside me!
